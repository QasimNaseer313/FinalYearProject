🧠 **VitalView – AI-Powered Nail-Based Health Screening**
VitalView is an AI-based mobile and web application designed to detect early signs of nail and related internal diseases from user-submitted nail images. This solution leverages machine learning to make healthcare more accessible and proactive, especially in the early identification of systemic conditions reflected through nail changes.

🧬 **Overview**
VitalView uses machine learning (CNN-based model) to analyze images of fingernails and identify patterns linked to diseases like:Psoriasis

Diabetes
Lung/Circulatory disorders
Melanoma
Onychomycosis
And more...

It is available as both a mobile (React Native) and web (React.js) application.

❗ **Problem Statement**
Despite nails being indicators of internal health, there is no widely available tool for early, automated detection of nail diseases. As a result, many people overlook early signs, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

🎯 **Aims & Objectives**
Develop a deep learning model to classify nail diseases with 80–90% accuracy.

Deploy this model through responsive web and mobile interfaces.

Provide an early-warning tool to encourage timely medical consultation.

🏥 **Medical Relevance**
Nail abnormalities are often the first visible signs of systemic illnesses. Some conditions linked to nail changes:

Condition	Related Illnesses
Melanoma	Skin cancer, metastasis to internal organs
Onychomycosis	Diabetes, vascular disease
Psoriatic Nails	Psoriatic arthritis, autoimmune disorders
Onychogryphosis	Poor circulation, neurological issues
Clubbing	Lung disease, heart/liver failure, IBD
Pitting	Psoriasis, alopecia, immune dysfunction
Blue Fingernails	Hypoxia, circulatory/respiratory failure

🌟 **Features**
📷 Upload or capture nail images
